      The Belgium-sized Hwange National Park is home to 50,000 elephants. Our guides will show you cheetahs, leopards, lions, endangered wild dogs, and rare species such as roan and sable. We will take you to the most beautiful places and show African wildlife as it is.
    </p>
    <p class="single-tour-day-one__info">
      On the first day, we get to know our group. The main meeting point is Victoria Falls, but you can also join us at other points that our managers will tell you about in person.

      At the first meeting, our guides will tell you about all the safety measures and rules of conduct on the safari. We will start our journey in two-wheel drive cars from the easternmost part of the park.
