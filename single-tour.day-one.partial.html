        The Belgium-sized Hwange National Park is home to 50,000 elephants. Our
        guides will show you cheetahs, leopards, lions, endangered wild dogs,
        and rare species such as roan and sable. We will take you to the most
        beautiful places and show African wildlife as it is.

        On the first day, we get to know our group. The main meeting point is
        Victoria Falls, but you can also join us at other points that our
        managers will tell you about in person.

        measures and rules of conduct on the safari. We will start our journey
        in two-wheel drive cars from the easternmost part of the park.
