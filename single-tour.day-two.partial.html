      <span>DAY 2</span> Exploring Hwange National Park
    </h2>
    <p>
      After a hearty buffet breakfast and enjoying the African morning, we get
      into 4x4 vehicles and begin our journey deep into the national park. Along
      the way, you will see huge herds of elephants, cheetahs hunting for
      zebras, rhinos yawning lazily in the hot African sun, and many other
      animals.
    </p>
    <p>
      One of the main advantages of Hwange National Park is its lack of crowds.
      Even during peak months, the park never gets crowded. You will feel unity
      with nature and find yourself the only observer of the life of wild
      animals for many kilometers. It's an amazing feeling!
    </p>
    <p>
      We will end this day by birdwatching. Birdwatchers will be impressed with
      the 500 species recorded here. Watching hundreds of birds flying in the
      sunset lights is even better than meditation. After sunset, we will return
      to our lodge to rest and recharge before the last day of our adventures. A
      hot dinner and unlimited drinks will be waiting for you.
