    <h2>DAY 3 saying goodbye to hwange national park</h2>
    <div>
        <p>
            This will be your last day in Hwange National Park, so we offer to make the most of it. Our guests will do a
            morning game drive in the private concession after breakfast. Then we'll return to the lodge to check out.

            However, our trip won't end at that point. We'll continue exploring the national park, going to the
            westernmost part of the reserve. There we offer you an extraordinary experience — a horseback safari. This
            activity should be booked in advance since there are different options: either short rides or whole-day
            adventures. You choose!

            We would like to note that our itinerary may vary slightly depending on the season. Our guides are well
            aware of the area and the habits of the animals. In addition, guides of different groups communicate with
            each other. Every morning they share information with each other about the location of certain animals, and
            we go to the places where lions, rhinos, buffaloes, and other members of the Big Five are noticed. That's
            why the itinerary remains flexible.

            We also want to clarify information about the seasonality of the safari tours. Actually, unlike other
            national parks in Zimbabwe, Hwange remains accessible in the wet summer season (November to April). Still,
            there's a little chance to spot a big game during these months, but, of course, you may be lucky. As a rule,
            these months are good for birdwatching, so if you like birds more than lions, you're always welcome! Also,
            you should know that the best months for safaris in Hwange National Park is July to October, although
            October is extremely hot.

                A Hwange National Park safari is sure to leave you with an unforgettable experience. Still, there are
                some
                things to remember:

        <div>
            <p>In no case do not break the rules and do not come close to wild animals;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Strictly follow the instructions of our guides and keep up with the group;</p>
        </div>
        <div>
            <p>Bring warm sweaters with you, as the nights in Africa can be cold.</p>
