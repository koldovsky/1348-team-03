          This will be your last day in Hwange National Park, so we offer to make the most of it. Our guests will do a
          morning game drive in the private concession after breakfast. Then we'll return to the lodge to check out.

          However, our trip won't end at that point. We'll continue exploring the national park, going to the
          westernmost
          part of the reserve. There we offer you an extraordinary experience — a horseback safari. This activity should
          be
          booked in advance since there are different options: either short rides or whole-day adventures. You choose!

          We would like to note that our itinerary may vary slightly depending on the season. Our guides are well aware
          of
          the area and the habits of the animals. In addition, guides of different groups communicate with each other.
          Every
          morning they share information with each other about the location of certain animals, and we go to the places
          where lions, rhinos, buffaloes, and other members of the Big Five are noticed. That's why the itinerary
          remains
          flexible.

          We also want to clarify information about the seasonality of the safari tours. Actually, unlike other
          national
          parks in Zimbabwe, Hwange remains accessible in the wet summer season (November to April). Still, there's a
          little
          chance to spot a big game during these months, but, of course, you may be lucky. As a rule, these months are
          good
          for birdwatching, so if you like birds more than lions, you're always welcome! Also, you should know that
          the
          best
          months for safaris in Hwange National Park is July to October, although October is extremely hot.

          A Hwange National Park safari is sure to leave you with an unforgettable experience. Still, there are some
          things
          to remember:
